Introduction
============
Okay so it's a somewhat stupid name, but what can you do I only have some many hours in the day to come up with names. 

Q. What is it?
A. It is an event display and plotting program for use with ANITA-II data in ROOT format. (In theory it could be used with ANITA-I data but it would need a quote a few mods to deal with the change in antenna number etc.

Q. Why should I use it?
A. That's a very good question, maybe you shouldn't. I find it is a useful way to look at the rootified data. I know there a people who don't like the rootified data and that's fine an updated AnitaViewer will do everything this does and a whole lot more.

Q. So what's the point?
A. My preferred way to look at the data is using the ROOT trees rather than the binary files. I find it easier to implement calibrations and unpacking in one place rather than everyone having to do it themselves. This provides people, well right now me, with a (hopefully) really simple way to look at the ROOT data files.

Q. How do I get it?
A. Read on, you can also visit the website at:
https://github.com/anitaNeutrino/anitaMagicDisplay

Prerequisites
=============
There are, unfortunately, several pre requisites for installing and running Magic Display.
i) ROOT -- If you don't have it installed get the latest version from http://root.cern.ch
ii) FFTW3 -- The Fastest Fourier Transform in the west. If you don't have libfftw3.so on your machine then you need to install it. Most linux distributions have a package ready to install, otherwise head to http://www.fftw.org/
iii) libRootFftwWrapper -- A wrapper that makes i) and ii) play nicely together. You can get it from github.
    git clone https://github.com/nichol77/libRootFftwWrapper.git
then see the README file for how to install and compile
iv) eventReaderRoot -- The ANITA event reader program. You can get it from github
    git clone https://github.com/anitaNeutrino/eventReaderRoot.git
Downloading
===========
The recommended way to download the program is from the git repository. Try doing:
git clone https://github.com/anitaNeutrino/anitaMagicDisplay.git

Installing
===========
Four steps to installation happiness:
i) Make sure the prerequisites are installed and accessible from your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
ii) Make SURE ANITA_UTIL_INSTALL_DIR is set and that the eventReader and libRootFftwWrapper files are installed there. (You probably want $ANITA_UTIL_INSTALL_DIR/lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
iii) type <from the magic display directory:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install


Running
=======
i) Get some ANITA III/IV data -- there's a tar file for testing on the website
http://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/uhen/anita/magicDisplay
ii) Edit macros/runMagicDisplay.C to point to your data and run number
iii) Type:
root macros/runMagicDisplay.C
